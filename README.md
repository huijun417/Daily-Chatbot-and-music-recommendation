# Daily-Chatbot-and-music-recommendation


We explore chatbots: different
implementations, models and uses. In our work, we
have found that there are three approaches to
designing a chatbot. The first model is the naive
method where a model is trained on specific responses.
The second, the sequential model is more flexible than
the naive model but performs poorly. Finally we looked
into pre-trained models, particularly DialoGPT, which
is pre-trained on reddit discussion threads and is able
to perform the most humanlike conversation and has
the most flexibility in its use.
